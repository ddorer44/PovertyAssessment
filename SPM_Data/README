Supplemental Poverty Measure files :

For R users who are not experienced with using SAS binary datasets,
I have converted the Census files on this download page

https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/supplemental-poverty-measure/acs-research-files.html

to the native R data format  .RData.  This files are too large to
post on GitHub so I have posted them here:

https://dorerfoundation.org/software/

The R functions in the PAT package merge these files with the "standard"
PUMS data downloaded via the API which is used in the PAT package.
There is a function that takes the geography, state, and PUMA FIPS along with a
list (character vector) of variable names. The downloaded data is placed
in a data.frame to be further processed by the Small Area Estimation (SAE)
part of the package.
