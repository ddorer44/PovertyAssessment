This R software produces synthetic tract and blockgroup level data starting with American Community Survey (ACS)
PUMS (Public Use Microdata) files for a PUMA (Public Use Microdata Area) together with a statistical model.
This technique is called "Small Area Estimation."

The PUMA level model is adjusted using marginal tables derived from ACS detailed tract and blockgroup tables.
The software uses the Census API to download data.  The PUMA level PUMS data can also be merged with the Supplemental
Poverty Measure SAS data file so that variables from that data can be used.

The software uses the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) algorithim for computation.  C source code is provided that
reproduces the Ipf function in the R package "mipfp."
